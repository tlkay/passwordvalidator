# password-validator

1. Create a new branch called "answer" to work on.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to see the password validator form.
3. Open the `src/script.js` file in your code editor to add your JavaScript code.

## Task List

Complete the following tasks to finish the exercise:

1. Write JavaScript code to validate the user's password. The password should meet the following requirements:
- Must be a minimum of 8 characters
- Must contain at least one lower case letter
- Must contain at least one upper case letter
- Must contain at least one numeric value
- Must contain at least one special character
2. Give the user some sort of notice if the password is valid or invalid. You can use JavaScript alerts, or modify the HTML/CSS to display a message.
3. Once you have completed the task, commit your changes and push the answer branch to your GitHub repository.
4. Start a new pull request from the answer branch to the main branch, and submit the pull request link.
